## Industry Experience

My most recent role as a Jr. Data Scientist at Veda Data Solutions allowed me to expand my skillset. During my tenure there, I gained valuable experience analyzing geo-location data from ESRI ARCGIS and Smarty, building out databases in SQL, and developing full-stack KPI dashboard microsites for internal stakeholders.

## Doctoral Research

I received my doctorate at the University of Missouri studying evolutionary genetics under [Dr. Libby King](https://elizabethking.org) in December 2022. My research focused on the genetics of dispersal and starvation resistance in the common fruit fly, *D. melanogaster*. I develop and utilize open-source statistical pipelines to analyze and visualize large datasets of genomic data. I primarily code in R & python, and I have experience in several languages, including C++, Java, MATLAB, SQL and more. I also have experience in parallel computing via bash scripting and CUDA.
